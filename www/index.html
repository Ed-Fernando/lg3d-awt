    Welcome to Project Looking Glass Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT) Project!
  </b></font></p>

  <p>
    This project is an <b>Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT)</b> for Project
    Looking Glass.  The primary goal is to be able to run unmodified
    AWT/Swing applications and applets inside the Looking Glass Desktop.
    An attempt has been made to make this implementation generic enough
    so that it can be used to run unmodified AWT/Swing applications
    inside any Java container (an already running JVM)
  </p>

  <p> <font color="#880000" size=+1><b> WARNING!</b></font> The code
    in the CVS repository for this project is currently incomplete and does
    not build properly. Please check back in a few weeks for a initial working
    implementation integrated with the Looking Glass core.
  </p> </body> </html>
